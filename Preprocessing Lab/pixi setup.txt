pixi installed WITHOUT the following:
[pypi-dependencies]
scikit-learn-extra = ">=0.3.0, <0.4"
pyradiomics-bhklab = ">=3.1.4, <4"

tried installing this first but DIDNT WORK:
cython = "*" # Required for building sklearn-extra
setuptools = "*" # Required for building from source
wheel = "*" # Also helps with building packages
