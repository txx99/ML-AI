# ML-AI
<<<<<<< HEAD
Various ML-AI-based coding projects, primarily in Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## DrugDiscovery
Build an ML model for drug discovery using the [ChEMBL database](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) of bioactive molecules with drug-inducing properties. Based on tutorial by [Chanin Nantasenamat](http://youtube.com/dataprofessor).

## ECG anomaly data
Compile 2 Keras autoencoders for labeling anomolous ECG data (4998 x 141).  

## ML-AI
Clinical Bioinformatics ML & AI coursework, including regression models, survival analysis, and supervised and unspervised ML models.
=======
