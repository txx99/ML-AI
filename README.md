# ML-Projects
Various ML-AI-based coding projects, primarily in Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## DrugDiscovery
Build an ML model for drug discovery using the [ChEMBL database](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) of bioactive molecules with drug-inducing properties. Based on tutorial by [Chanin Nantasenamat](http://youtube.com/dataprofessor).

## ECG Anomaly Autoencoders
Compile 2 Keras autoencoders (Functional API & Model Subclassing) for labeling anomolous ECG data (4998 x 141).  

## Life Expectancy Regression Analysis
Notebook comparing multiple regression models for predicting national life expectancy, based on the ["Country Life Expectancy"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amirhosseinmirzaie/countries-life-expectancy/data) dataset (2848 x 18), which provides population life expectancy and healthcare data for 178 countries from 2000 to 2015. \
Investigated regression models include: 
- LinearRegression, 
- RandomForestRegressor, 
- GradientBoostingRegressor, and 
- ExtraTreesRegressor.

## ML-AI_Course
Clinical Bioinformatics ML & AI coursework, including regression models, survival analysis, and supervised and unspervised ML models.
